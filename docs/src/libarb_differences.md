## LibArb's values do not remember their own precision

> The input values have no memory of the precision that was used to create them. An input value could be, say,    
`[1.0 +/- 0.25]`, regardless of whether the precision used to compute it was 2 bits, 100 bits, or 1000000 bits.

>Just think of a ball as a pair of rational numbers, not in terms of precision. The precision p for the new operation specifies (in almost all functions) that the midpoint of the output ball is to be rounded to at most p bits; if p = 100 then the output will be rounded to at most 100 bits even if the inputs have 1000000 bits.

## ArbNumerics's values remember their own precision

- works properly with mixed precision arithmetic
- works as intended with precision reduction
- maintains value integrity with precision expansion
